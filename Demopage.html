        <h4>
            <b><pre>* Sun Microsystems created the Java language.  Java is a case-sensitive programming language, like C++.  Java is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) structure.  Java is a class-based programming language. 
Java technology is used for developing both, applets and applications.</pre>
 
<b><pre> * Provides an easy to use:
Avoids many of the pitfalls of other languages
Bing object-oriented
Enables code streamlining
 
* an interpreted environment:
Improved speed of development.
Code portability.
 
(1) Loads classes dynamically, in other words when they are actually needed.
 
(2) Supports changing programs dynamically, during runtime, by loading classes from a distinct source.
 
(3) Furnishes better security.
 
(4) Enables use of more than one thread of activity.
 
(5) The Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
 
(6) Garbage collection.
 
(7) The Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
 
(8) JVM tool interface.
 
 JVM provides definitions for the:
Instruction Set (Central Processing Unit (CPU))
Register set
Class file format
Runtime stack
Garbage–collected head
Memory area
Fatal error reporting mechanism
High –precision timing support
